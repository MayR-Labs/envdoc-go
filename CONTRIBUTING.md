## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a code of conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please be respectful and considerate to others.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Set up the development environment
4. Create a new branch for your changes
5. Make your changes
6. Test your changes
7. Submit a pull request

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.25 or higher
- Git

### Setting Up Your Environment

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/envdoc-go.git
cd envdoc-go

# Add the upstream repository
git remote add upstream https://github.com/MayR-Labs/envdoc-go.git

# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Build the project
go build -o envdoc .

# Run the binary
./envdoc --help
```

## Making Changes

### Creating a Branch

Always create a new branch for your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

Branch naming conventions:
- `feature/` - for new features
- `fix/` - for bug fixes
- `docs/` - for documentation changes
- `refactor/` - for code refactoring

### Making Commits

Write clear and descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add new feature X"
git commit -m "fix: resolve issue with Y"
git commit -m "docs: update README with installation instructions"
```

Commit message format:
- `feat:` - new feature
- `fix:` - bug fix
- `docs:` - documentation changes
- `refactor:` - code refactoring
- `test:` - adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - maintenance tasks

## Code Style

### Go Style Guide

Follow the [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go) guidelines and these additional rules:

1. **Format your code**: Run `gofmt` before committing
   ```bash
   gofmt -w .
   ```

2. **Use meaningful names**: Variables, functions, and types should have descriptive names

3. **Keep functions small**: Each function should do one thing well

4. **Add comments**: Add comments for exported functions, types, and packages
   ```go
   // ParseEnvFile parses a .env file and returns a list of environment variables
   func ParseEnvFile(filename string) ([]EnvVar, error) {
       // implementation
   }
   ```

5. **Handle errors**: Always check and handle errors appropriately
   ```go
   if err != nil {
       return fmt.Errorf("failed to parse file: %w", err)
   }
   ```

6. **Use constants**: Define constants for magic values
   ```go
   const (
       defaultTimeout = 30 * time.Second
       maxRetries     = 3
   )
   ```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Run tests for a specific package
go test ./internal/parser

# Run tests in verbose mode
go test -v ./...
```

### Writing Tests

1. Place test files next to the code they test (e.g., `parser.go` â†’ `parser_test.go`)

2. Use table-driven tests when appropriate:
   ```go
   func TestParseEnvFile(t *testing.T) {
       tests := []struct {
           name    string
           input   string
           want    []EnvVar
           wantErr bool
       }{
           {
               name:  "valid file",
               input: "KEY=value",
               want:  []EnvVar{{Key: "KEY", Value: "value"}},
           },
           // more test cases...
       }
       
       for _, tt := range tests {
           t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
               got, err := ParseEnvFile(tt.input)
               if (err != nil) != tt.wantErr {
                   t.Errorf("ParseEnvFile() error = %v, wantErr %v", err, tt.wantErr)
               }
               // assertions...
           })
       }
   }
   ```
